# Mead
Dead simple markdown editor for Windows, Linux and Mac

![Mead markdown editor](https://github.com/perry-mitchell/mead/raw/master/preview-macos.jpg)

_Based mostly on the **beautful** [SimpleMDE markdown editor](https://simplemde.com/)._

## About
This is a proof of concept project, at the moment. It _may_ evolve into a somewhat proper editor of markdown files, but I make no promises. PRs are more than welcome and if there's enough interest it'll definitely take off.

For specifics on the markdown editor and preview be sure to check out the [SimpleMDE markdown editor](https://simplemde.com/) project as they've done all the hard work. This project is mostly just their editor placed in an Electron app for desktop-y usage.

## Features
Mead has a unique in-place markdown editor, which is actually SimpleMDE - It offers an interface to edit markdown in the same styling it describes. It also has a **preview pane** for side-by-side comparison.

Mead supports saving and loading files and multiple windows. It has hotkey support (New, Open and Save) and supports creating new documents.

## Developing
After running `npm install`, simply run `npm start` to start the app.
